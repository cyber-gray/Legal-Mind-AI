## Technical Architecture

### Semantic Kernel Integration
```python
# Agent creation with async function plugins
agent = Agent(
    service=chat_completion_service,
    name="AgentName",
    instructions="Agent instructions",
    execution_settings=execution_settings
)
```

### Group Chat Implementation
```python
# Multi-agent conversation flow
group_chat = GroupChat(
    agents=[coordinator, research_agent, policy_analyst],
    messages=[],
    max_round=10
)
```

### Storage Persistence
```python
# Azure Storage blob persistence
blob_client.upload_blob(
    json.dumps(conversation_data, indent=2),
    overwrite=True
)
```

## Successful Test Results

### ‚úÖ Latest Test Session Results
```
üéØ Starting Legal-Mind-AI Enhanced System Test
‚úÖ Legal-Mind-AI Enhanced System initialized successfully
